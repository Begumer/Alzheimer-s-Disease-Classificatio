# Alzheimer-s-Disease-Classification
ADNI-3 Dataset
The complete data set consists of all 5 parts.

Images can be resised after downloading. 
Afterwards, the classification labels in the CSV file should be matched with the images.

After the data set was matched with the CSV file, the models were run by allocating 70% for train and 30% for test.
